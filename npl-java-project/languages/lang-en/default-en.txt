21. Discuss the advantages of sudo over logging in to the root account. (10%)

The advantages of using sudo. Used properly, the sudo utility can greatly enhance the security of your systems, and it can make an administrator's job much easier. With sudo, you can do the following: Assign certain users full administrative privileges, while assigning other users only the privileges they need to perform tasks that are directly related to their respective jobs. Allow users to perform administrative tasks by entering their own normal user passwords so that you don't have to distribute the root password to everybody and his brother. Make it harder for intruders to break into your systems. If you implement sudo and disable the root user account, would-be intruders won't know which account to attack because they won't know which one has admin privileges. 
22. Explain Linux process niceness and its effect on scheduling priority. (5%)
23. Explain the role of systemctl subcommands: start, stop, status, restart, reload, enable, disable, isolate, and set-default, in managing systemd services and targets. (10%)
systemctl is a controlling interface and inspection tool for the widely-adopted init system and service manager systemd. This guide will cover how to use systemctl to manage systemd services, work with systemd Targets and extract meaningful information about your system’s overall state.
